# Deep Fundamental Matrix Estimation

This repository contains code for training a network as described in our [paper](http://vladlen.info/papers/deep-fundamental.pdf):

The trained network can be used to compute a fundamental matrix based on noisy point correspondences.

## Setup


Create and activate conda environment:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dfe
```

## Train

Training can be performed with the following command:

```shell
python train.py --dataset [dataset folders]
```

Dataset folders are assumed to be in COLMAP format. Multiple folders can be listed by separating them with a whitespace.

An example dataset can be found here: [Family](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b4lb5La3dzn_D87sy-fpgCAbEnGRSLrL).

To get help:

```shell
python train.py -h
```


## Test

```shell
python test.py --dataset [dataset folders] --model [path to model]
```

A pre-trained model that was trained on Tanks and Temples can be found in the models folder.


## Creating your own dataset

The dataloader assumes that a dataset folder contains the following files:

```shell
reconstruction.db 
sparse/0/cameras.bin
sparse/0/images.bin

```

`cameras.bin` and `images.bin` are SfM reconstruction in COLMAP format. 

`reconstruction.db` contains descriptors, matches, etc.

These files are automatically created when performing reconstruction using COLMAP. We found that better results are achieved with less aggressive filtering for feature matching than the default COLMAP settings. The recommended way to create a training set is:

1) Run COLMAP to produce `cameras.bin` and `images.bin` and initial `reconstruction.db`
2) Run `get_features.sh` to produce a training set with higher outlier ratios to replace `reconstruction.db`
